# An application to look at photos of birds
The application looks good but doesn't have all the photos available for all the birds.
The test birds I chose are good looking ;) 
I hope you feel better Joe I'll see you next term
My program works on Unix machines it seems it pulls on mine because the directory is accurate
I couldn't find an efficient way to convert the directories and ran into a wall. 
If you could give me a clue and let me fix it that would be amazing. If not oh well. 

Thank you for your hard work this term
Sincerely,
Liam
